-- Per-business GST rate. Tree Mate is Australian (10% GST today) but
-- the rate could change at any time. The hardcoded 0.10 in
-- src/lib/utils.js calculateGST + literal "GST (10%)" labels in
-- QuoteBuilder, InvoiceBuilder, PublicQuote, and Jobs (3 places)
-- made an across-the-board rate change a code-deploy task instead
-- of a settings change.
--
-- Per-doc gst_rate is also added to quotes + invoices so historical
-- documents keep whatever rate they were issued under. Today
-- quotes.gst / invoices.gst store only the *amount* — without the
-- rate column, an operator changing their default rate would render
-- old draft docs with the new rate label even though their gst
-- amount was computed at the old rate. The rate column closes that
-- gap.
--
-- numeric(5,4) → up to 9.9999 (we won't see four-digit GST rates),
-- four decimal places handles 0.1234 cases like split rates without
-- floating-point drift.
