-- Per-business GST opt-in. Until a business hits the AU GST
-- registration threshold ($75k turnover), they're not allowed to
-- charge GST on quotes / invoices. The previous migration (007)
-- assumed GST was always charged and only let the operator pick
-- the rate, so an unregistered tradie still saw "GST 10%" on every
-- doc with no way to remove it (typing "0" silently snapped back
-- to the default).
--
-- Default true preserves current behaviour for any existing rows.
-- New tradies (or existing ones who flip this off) get rate=0
-- written onto new docs, the GST line is hidden in totals / PDFs /
-- portal pages, and the inline-modal totals on Jobs.jsx skip the
-- GST row entirely.
--
-- Per-doc gst_rate stays as the source of truth for an issued doc,
-- so toggling this off at the business level doesn't retroactively
-- rewrite history.
